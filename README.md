Read the Titanic dataset and perform Data Science on it using Pandas and SkyLearn.

This data science example was inspired by and many portions derived from the following two articles:  

"Predicting the Survival of Titanic Passengers" by Niklas Donges
https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-the-survival-of-titanic-passengers-30870ccc7e8
       
"Building a Machine Learning Model Step By Step With the Titanic Dataset" by Taha Bilal Uyar
https://medium.com/swlh/building-a-machine-learning-model-step-by-step-with-the-titanic-dataset-e3462d849387

The data pre-processing employed is different from what each author did, so the results in each article are not exact, but they are very close. 
By following the two articles and reviewing and executing this code, you can learn a lot about data science from these authors.
